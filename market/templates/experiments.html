<h1>Experiments</h1>
<p>
    Using the simulation, several situations will be studied and compared below.
    In all experiments, a minimum price of 1 euros and a maximum price of 20 euros is used.<br>
</p>
</div>
<div class = "content_box">
  <h1> Negotiation </h1>
  <p>
    When negotiating, buyers use knowledge they have gathered by exchanging knowledge with each
    other, next to their own knowledge and beliefs to negotiate with each other and to get a price
    that maximizes the surplus, which is the advantage for both the seller as well as the buyer.
    A deal is made whenever there is an overlap in the prices the seller considers possible and
    the prices the buyer considers possible. Furthermore, as buyers interact with each other, it might
    be possible that a buyer knows about the last transaction, a seller currently traded with, and what
    the price of that transaction was. When the buyer knows the seller sold a product for 4 euros previously,
    it will not accept a price of 5 euros for a deal. Simulations were run for 3000 days.
    Furthermore, in all plots in this section, 10 pairs of buyers exchange knowledge every day, and
    sellers do not share information.<br>
    The figure below shows the convergence of the market price when the number of buyers equals the
    number of sellers. In this simulation, there are 100 sellers and 100 buyers.
</p>
<img src="../static/plots/neg_100_100.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" width="50%">
<p>
    <br>
    Two things can be observed. First the average transaction price during a day stabilizes after
    approximately 1000 days, and after this there is almost no change in price anymore. Second, the
    price convergences in favor of the buyers, which makes sense, as the buyers share valuable information
    with each other, concerning where prices are cheap (which sellers sell for a lower price) and what
    is the cost there. The average transaction price stabilizes around 3 euros. The stabilization is also confirmed
    by the decreasing standard deviation of the transaction price (light green).<br><br>

    When increasing the number of buyers in the simulation to 110 buyers, the demand raises, while
    the supply stays the same (the number of sellers is still 100). This leads to the expectation that
    the price will stabilize at a higher value. When looking at the figure below, this is exactly what
    can be observerd.
</p>
<img src="../static/plots/neg_110_100.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" width="50%">
<p>
    <br>
    When comparing the two figures above, we see that the price now stabilizes around 5 euros, whereas
    before this was approximately 3 euros. The stabilization is again confirmed by the standard deviation
    decreasing and staying constant around 5 euros.<br><br>

    Next, the number of buyers were increased further to 150 buyers. The figure below shows the
    convergence of the price for this particular situation.
</p>
<img src="../static/plots/neg_150_100.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" width="50%">
<p>
    <br>
    It is observed that the sellers actually dominate the market. The price stabilizes much closer to
    the maximum possible price (which is 20 euros). Furthermore this price is reached much faster
    compared to the previous simulations. The price stabilizes around 15 euros.<br><br>

    Finally 2 extreme situations will be considered in which the number of buyers is three times as high
    as the number of sellers (hence 300 buyers and 100 sellers) and a situation in which the number of
    sellers is much higher than the number of buyers (100 sellers and 10 buyers).

</div>
<p>
    <br>
    As can be seen in those extreme scenarios of an unbalanced market, in the case of too many buyers
    compared to the sellers (left) the price almost instantly converges to the maximum price. In the case of
    too few buyers compared to sellers (right), the average price of the sellers almost instantly drops to the
    minimum possible price.

    <h1> Grocery Store </h1>
    In the following experiments, a grocery store situation is assumed. In this situation, when buyers
    approach a seller, the seller just offers the price it thinks is right. The buyer can either take
    it or leave it. In our simulation, whenever the offer of the seller is within the prices the buyer
    considers possible for this particular seller (recall that all buyers keep track and exchange
    knowledge about sellers and their price), the buyer will take the deal. Otherwise no deal is made.
    In all simulations, 1000 days were simulated. Again, 10 pairs of buyers exchange knowledge and no
    sellers exchange knowledge.<br>
    In the figure below we start out with 100 buyers and 100 sellers.
</p>
<img src="../static/plots/gro_100_100.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" width="50%">
<p>
    <br>
    It can be observed that the price decreases and converges around 2 euros. Furthermore it can
    be seen that the overal convergence is decreases inverse exponentially over the duration of the
    simulation, in contrast with the negotiation situation where some sort of stages can be observed
    before a stable price is reached.<br><br>

    When increasing the number of buyers, the same behaviour can be observed as above, except the
    price stabilizes at a higher value, namely at 4 euros. Furthermore it can be seen in the figure below
    that the price stabilizes slower.
</p>
<img src="../static/plots/gro_120_100.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" width="50%">
<p>
    <br>
    Lastly we show again two extreme situations. One in which the number of buyers are twice the number
    of sellers (200 buyers and 100 sellers) and one in which the number of buyers are much lesser than the number of sellers (40 buyers and 100 sellers).
</p>
<div class="row">
    <div class="column">
        <img src="../static/plots/gro_200_100.png" style="width:100%">
    </div>
    <div class="column">
        <img src="../static/plots/gro_40_100.png" style="width:100%">
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    As expected, in the case where there are many more buyers than sellers (left), the price very quickly
    reaches the maximum price. In the case where there are many more sellers than buyers (right), the
    price quickly converges to the minimum price.
</p>

    <h1> Sharing Knowledge </h1>
    In above simualtions, buyers shared knowledge for a fixed number of times after every day. Now we will inspect
    market behaviour when the number of interactions between buyers at the end of every day is varied.
    In the figures below, we will show 4 different situations. First the original situation is
    showed (again) in which 10 pairs of the buyers exchange knowledge about sellers who sell
    at a particular price.
</p>
<img src="../static/plots/neg_100_100.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" width="50%">
<p>
    <br>
    Next, we will increase this number of buyer pairs that exchange knowledge to 100.
    This means that almost all buyers (they are selected randomly)
    will interact with at least one other buyer. As can be seen in the figure below, this speeds up the proces
    of the stabilizing price enormously. However, still the same price is reached, which is approximately
    3 euros. The equilibrium price is reached (approximately) 4 times as fast.
</p>
<img src="../static/plots/neg_100_100_much_share.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" width="50%">
<p>
    <br>
    In contrast, when decreasing the number of interactions to 5, we see that the same equilibrium is still
    reached, but it is reached slower, as knowledge gets exchanged less often. This obviously makes logical sense.
    The figure below shows this behaviour.
</p>
<img src="../static/plots/neg_100_100_5_share.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" width="50%">
<p>
    <br>
    When flipping the behaviour, thus letting sellers exchange knowledge about the price, and buyers
    not, we would expect an inverse behaviour. When we let 10 pairs of sellers exchange knowledge every
    day, we see that indeed an equilibrium in favor of the sellers arises (note that the price lies around 15 euros).
    This behaviour can be seen in the figure below.
</p>
<img src="../static/plots/neg_100_100_seller_share.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" width="50%">
<p>
    <br>
    Finally, when decreasing the number of interactions to 0, another interesting behaviour arises.
    In this situation, buyers do not have an advantage over sellers because no knowledge is exchanged. As
    can be seen in the figure below, this yields an equilibrium price approximately in the middle of the
    possible prices. Here, no type of agent has an advantage over the other, hence the price is 'optimal'
    for both sellers and buyers in the sense that the price is (approximately) in the middle of both optimums
    of both agents (where a price of 1 is the optimum for buyers and 20 is the optimum for sellers).
    The figure below shows this logical behaviour.

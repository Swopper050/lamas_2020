<h1>Experiments</h1>
<p>
    Using the simulation several situations will be studied and compared below.
    In all experiments, a minimum price of 1 euro's and a maximum price of 20 euros is used.
    Furthermore, 2000 days will be simulated every time.<br>

    <h1> Negotiation </h1>

    When negotiating, agents use knowledge they have gathered by exchanging knowledge with each
    other, next to their own knowledge and beliefs to negotiate with each other and to get a price
    that maximizes the surplus, which is the advantage for both the seller as well as the buyer.
    A deal is made whenever there is an overlap in the prices the seller considers possible and
    the prices the buyer considers possible. Furthermore, as buyers interact with each other, it might
    be possible that a buyer knows about the last transaction the seller currently traded with, and what
    the price of that transaction was. When the buyer knows the seller sold a product for 4 euros previously,
    it will not accept a price of 5 euros for a deal.<br>
    The figure below shows the convergence of the market price when the number of buyers equals the
    number of sellers. In this simulation there are 100 sellers and 100 buyers.

    <br>
    Two things can be observed. First the average transaction price during a day stabilizes after
    approximately 1200 days, and after this there is almost no change in price anymore. Second, the
    price convergences in favor of the buyers, which makes sense, as the buyers share valuable information
    with each other, concerning where prices are cheap (which sellers sell for a lower price) and what
    the price there actually is. The price stabilizes around 3 euros. The stabilization is also confirmed
    by the decreasing standard deviation of the transaction price (light green).<br><br>

    When increasing the number of buyers in the simulation to 110 buyers, the demand raises, while
    the supply stays the same (the number of sellers is still 100). This leads to the expectation that
    the price will stabilize at a higher value. When looking at the figure below, this is exactly what
    can be observerd.
</p>

<p>
    <br>
    When comparing the two figures above, we see that the price now stabilizes around 5 euros, whereas
    before this was approximately 3 euros. The stabilization is again confirmed by the standard deviation
    decreasing and staying constant around 5 euros.<br><br>

    Now the number of buyers will be increased even further to 150 buyers. The figure below shows the
    convergence of the price for this particular situation.
</p>

<p>
    <br>
    Here it can be seen that the sellers actually dominate the market. The price stabilizes much closer to
    the maximum possible price (which is 20 euros). Furthermore this price is reached much faster
    compared to the previous simulations. The price stabilizes around 15 euros.<br><br>

    Finally 2 extreme situations will be considered in which the number of buyers is twice as high
    as the number of sellers (hence 200 buyers and 100 sellers) and a situation in which the number of
    sellers is twice as high as the number of buyers (thus 200 sellers and 100 buyers).

</div>
<p>
    <br>
    As can be seen in those extreme scenarios of an unbalanced market, in the case of too much buyers
    compared to the sellers the price almost instantly converges to the maximum prices. In the case of
    too few buyers compared to sellers, the average price of the sellers almost instantly drops to the
    minimum possible price.
